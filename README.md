# About
Human emotion plays a vital role in recent times. Emotion is based on human feelings which can 
be both expressed or not. Emotion expresses the humanâ€™s individual behavior which can be in 
different forms. Extraction of the emotion states humans individual state of behavior. The objective 
of this project is to extract feature from human face and detect emotion and to play music according 
to the emotion detected. In this project, developing a prototype to recommend dynamic music 
recommendation system based on human emotions is our main aspect. Based on each human 
listening pattern, the songs for each emotion are trained. Integration of feature extraction and 
machine learning techniques, from the real face the emotion is detected and once the mood is 
derived from input image, respective songs for the specific mood would be played to hold the 
users. In this approach, the application gets connected with human feelings thus giving an 
individualized touch to the users. Our projected system concentrates on identifying the human 
feelings for development of a mood-based music player using computer vision and machine 
learning techniques. Some steps like face detection using webcam, facial landmark extraction, 
facial expression detection, with that connecting to a music player are going to be followed. For 
experimental results, Haar cascade algorithm and Computer vision for emotion detection and 
music recommendation.
